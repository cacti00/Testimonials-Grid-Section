## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

One of the critical things I learned was grid-tempate-areas and grid-template columns. 

This challenge was mainly to test my knowledge on grid and I'm happy I was able to compete the challenge to the best of my abilities. 


```html
 <li class="testimonial-profiles-profile profile1 "></li>
```
```css
 .profile1 {
        grid-area: daniel-testimonial;
    }
```




### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.


For future projects I will focus on creating responsive layouts either with grid-temlate-areas or grid-template-columns.
